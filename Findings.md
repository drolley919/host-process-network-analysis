# Findings

- Multiple running processes were identified during live system enumeration.
- Several processes required additional review due to unfamiliar names, execution paths, or behavior.
- Active network connections were observed communicating with external hosts.
- Certain network connections were identified as unexpected based on typical system usage patterns.
- Executable files associated with suspicious processes were isolated for validation.
- Hash analysis was performed on selected executables to support threat intelligence correlation.
- No evidence was identified indicating system instability or disruption at the time of analysis.
