# Host Process & Network Forensic Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a host-based forensic investigation focused on analyzing running processes and active network connections to identify potentially suspicious or unauthorized activity on a Windows system. The objective was to simulate a real-world incident response scenario and demonstrate the ability to collect, analyze, and interpret volatile host data in support of a security investigation.

## Investigation Objectives
- Identify active processes and associated network connections
- Detect indicators of suspicious or anomalous host behavior
- Correlate process activity with network communication
- Document findings in a structured, defensible forensic report

## Skills Demonstrated
- Host-based forensic analysis
- Process and network activity correlation
- Identification of suspicious execution and communication patterns
- Evidence-driven investigative reporting
- Clear technical documentation for security and incident response audiences

## Tools & Techniques
- Windows native utilities
- Host process enumeration techniques
- Network connection analysis
- Forensic documentation and reporting methodologies

## Repository Structure
- **Executive-Summary.md** — High-level overview of investigative findings and impact  
- **Evidence.md** — Collected forensic artifacts supporting the investigation  
- **Analysis.md** — Analytical reasoning and interpretation of host and network data  
- **Findings.md** — Confirmed findings derived from evidence  
- **Recommendations.md** — Security recommendations based on investigative outcomes  
- **Assets/screenshots/** — Supporting screenshots and visual evidence  

## Why This Matters
Host-based process and network analysis is a foundational skill for SOC Analysts, Incident Responders, and Digital Forensics professionals. This investigation demonstrates the ability to move beyond tool output and translate technical findings into actionable security insight.
